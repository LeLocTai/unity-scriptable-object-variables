# Scriptable Object Variables with UniRx
This is my implementation of variables in Unity using scriptable objects as explained in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk&t=3289s) talk. The change is that the exposed variable is actually Observable of the variable type so it is compatible with UniRx.
